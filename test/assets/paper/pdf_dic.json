The creation of new enriched and functional products contributes to the formation of  a healthy type of nutrition in the population. The combination of processed wheat grain  processing products into a complex nutritional supplement that can be used for enrichment will  expand the range of functional products. As objects of study, a concentrate from germinated  wheat grains and juice from green wheat sprouts were determined. Samples of complex  nutritional supplements were prepared with different component ratios. Comparative results of  organoleptic evaluation and physicochemical parameters of complex nutritional supplement  samples are presented. The formulation of the complex nutritional supplement was optimized by  the total quality factor, the most effective ratio of the concentrate from germinated wheat grains  and juice from green wheat sprouts - 40:60. The study of the conditions and shelf life of the  finished complex food additives, packaged in a vacuum bag, was carried out at a temperature of  -18 ± 2  ℃ , air humidity of 75%. Quality control was carried out at 3 control points during 48  days of storage. The developed complex food additive, packed in a vacuum bag and frozen at a  temperature of -18 ± 2  ℃ , air humidity of 75% has a shelf life of 40 days and can be widely used  in the enrichment of drinks. The complex nutritional supplement from germinated wheat has the  following indicators: dry matter content - 21.89%, vitamin C - 4.3 mg, vitamin B 1  - 0.13 mg,  vitamin B 2  - 0.1 mg, vitamin B 6  - 0.17 mg, fiber - 0.72 g. The resulting complex nutritional  supplement has increased nutritional value. ",

One of the sources of enrichment of the diet is sprouted wheat, which is  several times richer than vitamins, macro- and microelements 50 times richer than vitamin E, 10 times  richer than vitamin B6, 3-4 times richer than vitamins F and P 4-5 times richer in fatty acids, 2-3 times  richer in amino acids, and also contains phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, manganese, calcium, zinc,  iron, selenium, copper, vanadium, etc. It is established that the introduction of germinated grain in the  diet improves metabolism and blood formation, boosts immunity, replenishes vitamin th and mineral  deficiency, stabilizes the acid-base balance, aids in digestion and intensive cleansing the body of toxins.  In addition, enzyme systems are activated in the germinated grain, which break down complex  substances into simpler, easily absorbed by the human body [1-3].  Another source of enrichment, which contains a significant amount of nutrients, vitamins, macro-  and microelements, enzymes, essential amino acids, is the juice from the green wheat sprouts. It contains  chlorophyll, which inhibits the development of cancer, promotes tissue regeneration and stimulates the ",

            "text": "4. Conclusions   As a result of the studies, the obtained complex nutritional supplement from germinated wheat has the  following optimal ratio of concentrate from germinated wheat grain and juice from green wheat sprouts  equal to 40:60. The complex nutritional supplement from germinated wheat has high organoleptic  characteristics, is safe by microbiological indicators. The shelf life of a complex nutritional supplement  of germinated wheat in a vacuum package frozen at an adjustable temperature of -18 ± 2 ° C, air humidity  of 75% is 40 days. The use of 100 g of a complex nutritional supplement from germinated wheat satisfies  the daily need of the human body for protein by 6.3-5.57%, fiber - 3.6%, vitamin C - 4.7%, vitamin B 1   - 8.6%, B 2  - 5.55%, B 6  - 8.5%, in iron - 8.3-15%, magnesium - 12.7%, potassium - 5.1%, which indicates  a high nutritional value of the product. This complex nutritional supplement can be used in the catering  system in order to obtain drinks (smoothies) and other products of high nutritional value. ",
